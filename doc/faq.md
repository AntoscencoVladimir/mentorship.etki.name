### XXX is done bad / there is better solution for YYY / ZZZ looks clumsy to me

There should have been a link to "Grayarea - Was There Ever Time?", but, sadly
and absurdly, free music is shared not as widely as priced, so i couldn't get a
link to a decent online player. So, instead of telling this ironically, i have
to tell it directly: i simply don't have enough time and desire to fix
everything. 

You can have this wonderful duck instead, though:
